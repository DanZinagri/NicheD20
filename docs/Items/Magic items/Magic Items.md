Magic items are a series of tools at a player’s disposal to increase their versatility. If a magic item would call for a save attack the caster may substitute it with 1d20 + ½ their ranks in UMD + his Psyche modifier. Many magic items will have a save DC rather than a normal attack roll, effectively treating the save attack as if it had rolled a 10.

Magic items have a BCB listed, but this is for the purpose of crafting and other effects and is not a requirement to utilize or wear the magic item.

# Magic Item Slots

Magic items come in 2 forms, slotted and slotless. A slotless magic item usually requires the creature to be holding the item to activate it, similar to wielding a weapon or implement.

Slotted magic items may be activated without holding them, but occupy a specific part of a character’s body. Two magic items cannot occupy the same slot and both become inoperable until one is removed.

Slots Include the following:

- Head
- Neck
- Body
- Hand(2)
- Feet

If a creature would lack an appropriate appendage a reasonable substitution may be suggested, but generally that creature is disallowed from wearing that magic item. For example a creature without legs and feet would be unable to wear feet slot items; though a creature without arms, but has tentacles, may be able to wear a ring or wrist slot item on them.

A creature with a hand slot has 2 hand slots as some items may only be equipped to a single hand, though some items may come in pairs and as such occupy both hand slots. Items that do not specify that they come in pairs can be equipped to a single hand allowing a different hand slot item on each hand.

## Magic Item Attunement

Before a magic item within a slot may be worn, it must first be attuned to. Attunement begins at the start of each day, usually after a creature has performed their rest, though a creature can perform attunement at any point during the day. Attuning to an item takes a standard action once it is worn in a slot.

Magic items worn in slots cannot be utilized until attuned to, and once attuned the wearer of that item cannot utilize a different magic item in that slot until they take an 8 hour rest and gain the opportunity to attune to a different magic item.

Items that were previously attuned to before the rest may be chosen to be automatically attuned to again at the start of the day without spending an action, though if the character does not choose to renew the attunement then the item cannot be used until it has been attuned to.

A creature may re-attune to a new magic item, despite being already attuned to another a number of times per day equal to their Psyche modifier (minimum 1). Doing removed attunement from the previous item and attunes them to the new item, making them unable to utilize the previously attuned item until they are able to attune again to it.

# Temporary Magic Items

Items marked as temporary are items usually with a limited function. These items do not take up a slot as normal, nor are they restricted to the attunement system. Instead a temporary magic item has its own special slot in which only one of the item may be equipped at a time; otherwise no temporary magic items will function until the excess is removed.. A temporary magic item may only be used while equipped, though may be unequipped at any time. Most temporary magic items have a single use or limited number of uses before they are spent; once a temporary magic item is spent a new temporary magic item may be equipped without conflict with the previous.
