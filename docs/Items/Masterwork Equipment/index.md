Equipment, such as weapons and armor, can be made into masterwork versions of themselves. A masterwork version is a higher quality than normal, with varying degrees of masterwork. This is separate magical enhancements on a weapon, and rather are mundane modifications and boosts that can be made to a weapon to make a greater version of itself. The following are the quality levels for weapons:

|Quality|Base Cost Increase|Craft DC Increase|Base Progress per Day|Modification Slots|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Common*|0|0|+0 gp|0|
|Uncommon|200 gp|10|+4 gp|1|
|Rare|3,200 gp|20|+64 gp|2|
|Exceptional|16,200 gp|30|324 gp|4|
|Legendary|51,200 gp|40|1024 gp|7|

*While listed, common is considered the base quality of a weapon and this is not actually yet masterwork.

The craft DC increase is the increase over the existing crafting DC to create the weapon or armor; while the base cost increase is added to the base price of an item when creating it anew. Progress per day is added on top of the existing progress per day for the weapon. Most weapons and armor have their cost, DC, and progress split between its simple, martial, or exotic versions. Each level of quality increases the base crafting price of an item significantly, while also providing additional benefits. For each rank of quality above common, the item gains an additional 1 Hardness and 10 hit points over the base hardness and hit points of the item.

In addition each rank of quality adds modification slots. This allows for additional modifications without compromising the quality or structure of the equipment. Some modifications potentially cost more than one modification slot. Unless otherwise specified a modification cannot be added to an item more than once. Modifications must be chosen to be added at the time the weapon is upgraded, and if not chosen it is assumed Durable was chosen to fill any unused modification slots.

## Masterwork and Double Weapons

When applied to a double weapon, unlike enchanting, the entire weapon benefits from the masterwork rank and all modifications are applied to both ends. If one end would be eligible for a benefit while another wouldn't, only the end that qualifies may benefit from this.

## Masterwork and Combination Weapons

Unlike double weapons, combination weapons work slightly differently. The entire weapon still benefits from the masterwork rank, but the overall cost is increased. In addition modifications are applied to each end separately and utilize slots separately, but each end receives less than a normal weapon would.

See the chart below for the changes:

|Quality|Base Cost Increase|Modification Slots|
|---|---|---|
|Common*|0|0|
|Uncommon|300 gp|1|
|Rare|4,800 gp|2|
|Exceptional|24,300 gp|3|
|Legendary|76,800 gp|5|

## Masterwork Implements

Implements that are not weapons can be made masterwork but unless they are a weapon cannot receive the same modifications as a weapon. Otherwise masterwork implements receive the same bonus to hit points and hardness a weapon would. Like other masterwork equipment, its modifications and benefits are entirely mundane, as a result most masterwork implements do not grant a direct benefit to spellcasting for being masterwork, but may be modified to grant other utility benefits.

This may be selected more than once; for every 2 times it's been applied to the weapon the weapon’s hardness also improves by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1         |
| Reservoir(Weapon) | The weapon’s hilt or other handle is hollowed out along with a portion of the weapon. The hilt may store up to 3 doses of any liquid; as a reaction the wielder may press a switch on the weapon to cause the liquid inside to coat the weapon. If the weapon gains the broken condition all the contents within are immediately drained onto the ground and can no longer be utilized to coat the blade.<br><br>If utilized with poison this causes the weapon to be treated as if it had a dose of poison applied to it (without the usual risk of poisoning oneself).<br><br>If utilized with other liquids (such as holy water), these coat the weapon and only have effect on a hit with the weapon if the liquid would normally have an effect on contact or injury of another creature. The liquid can potentially damage the weapon if it would normally be capable of damaging it (such as a highly potent acid being stored). Unless the liquid would normally last longer when applied to a weapon, liquids used in this way last for 1 minute or the next successful attack with the weapon (whichever comes first).<br><br>For each masterwork rank above uncommon the weapon may store one additional dose of liquid. | 2         |
| Retracting        | As a 1 AP action the weapon retracts into a smaller version of itself. With another 1 AP action returning it to its normal state.<br><br>When activated the weapon instead is treated as being a size smaller for the effort required to wield it (two-handed weapons become one-handed, one handed become light) but doing so causes the weapon damage to be reduced by one step, and it loses any reach quality if it possessed it (regaining it when returned to its normal size. If used to reduce a weapon below light it instead is treated as if it possessed the folding property.<br><br>This modification may be applied more than once, each time allowing the weapon to be reduced an additional step. The wielder may always choose to alter the weapon by more than one step as part of the 1 AP action utilized to reduce or expand it, rather than needing to spend additional AP to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 1         |
| Scoped            | This modification may only be applied to trigger keyword ranged weapons.<br><br>When making a focused attack with the modified ranged weapon you reduce the penalty for firing beyond the first range increment by 1 for each increment beyond the first (minimum 0). This only applies to the focused attack and not any extra or additional attacks made as part of the focused attack.<br><br>You may select this modification a second time you increase the maximum number of range increments you may fire the weapon by 50% (usually improving from 10 to 15).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1         |
| Serrated          | This modification may only be applied to melee weapons that deal piercing or slashing damage.<br><br>The selected weapon gains the serrated weapon feature. If the weapon already possessed the serrated feature it instead improves the base bleed damage to 1d4+1.<br><br>This modification may be taken twice if the weapon did not originally possess the serrated weapon feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1         |
| Sharpened Edge    | This modification may only be applied to shields.<br><br>The shield may deal slashing damage or its base damage type (usually piercing or slashing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 1         |
| Softening         | This modification may only be applied to melee weapons that deal bludgeoning damage.<br><br>After successfully striking or sundering an object, the object's hardness is reduced by 5 until the start of your next turn; this applies after damage against the object has resolved. This modification does not stack with itself or other instances of the softening modification. When striking a larger object (such as a wall) only the portion struck is affected rather than the entire structure. The hardness of the object is reduced by an additional 1 per masterwork rank above uncommon the weapon possesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2         |
| Weighted Head     | This modification may only be applied to melee weapons that deal bludgeoning damage.<br><br>The weapon deals an additional 50% of the user’s strength modifier on weapon damage rolls.

| Armor Spikes        | The armor gains the razored property if it did not already possess it, if the armor already possessed this feature, treat the armor as if it already had this feature selected once for determining the effects of taking this modification additional times.<br><br>Selecting this modification a second causes its effects to apply anytime a creature strikes the wearer with a melee attack using an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or an unarmed touch attack rather than only when the creature misses by 5 or fewer.<br><br>Selecting this modification a third time allows the wearer to use their armor spikes offensively, allowing them to make attack rolls with it as if it were a light simple weapon with the light and blade keywords, deals 1d4 damage and with a crit of 20 x2. This uses the armor’s enhancement bonus for determining enhancement bonuses to attack and damage and may have weapon special abilities applied to it separately from the armor’s special abilities. | 1         |

| Greater Vital Guard | If the armor this is applied to does not already possess the Vital Guard armor feature the cost of this modification increases by 1 and also grants the vital guard feat in additional to its normal effect.<br><br>Armor with this modification causes attacks made against them to treat the critical threat range of their weapons as 1 lower (to a minimum of 20). Thus a weapon with a 18-20 crit range would only crit on a 19 or 20 rather than the normal range of the weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 2         |

| Durable(Implement)   | The implement gains an additional 3 hit points. This may be selected more than once; for every 2 times it's been applied to the weapon the implement’s hardness also improves by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1         |

# Reforging Existing Equipment

The above system assumes you have an item being specially crafted for, or by, you. When upgrading to the next tier of quality you may take the difference between the current quality of your weapon and the next quality and pay the difference in cost. Doing this does not remove or modify existing modifications, simply adds the slots to add in new modifications.

When looking to modify an existing weapon to change its modifications, you must pay 10% of the cost of the item’s current rank to reforge its existing modifications into new ones.

When looking to upgrade in quality, but also replace all existing modifications applied, you must pay the difference in price, plus the 10% cost of the current rank to both increase the quality and allow for changing of existing enhancements it possesses.
