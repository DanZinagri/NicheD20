This section details rules, costs, and benefits of enhancing weapons, armor, and implements.

# Base Enhancing Rules

Items such as weapons, armor, and implements are enhanced in one of two ways; directly or gem and seal enhancement. The primary form being Gem and Seal Enhancement.

## Gem and Seal Enhancement

When using gem and seal enhancements and special abilities are not tied to the item itself and rather are within Gems and Seals. Each weapon or armor has a single Gem slot and a Seal slot on them. Enhancement gems and seals are typed to Weapons, Armor, and Implements only able to be attached to the type of equipment they were designed for. This means a Gem designed for armor would have no benefit when applied to a weapon.

Enhancement Gems and seals may be broken to enchant 50 pieces of ammunition. Once done this way the ammunition receives the enchantments/special abilities as normal; but this consumes the gem and seal in the process and the enchantments may no longer be transferred.

If a weapon or armor already provides an enhancement bonus or has special abilities, applying a gem or seal overwrites any enhancement bonus or special abilities the weapon already possesses until they are removed.

Armor that is destroyed also destroys any enhancement gem or seals it may possess until the armor is restored; at which point they may be removed from the armor again.

Unless otherwise specified a piece of equipment may only have a single enhancement gem and seal applied to it at once; additional enhancement gems and seals applied to it have no effect.

### Enhancement Gems

Enhancement Gems range from +1 to +5, and when applied to a weapon or armor grant the equipment an enhancement bonus. This may be attached as a 3 AP action, and may be removed as a 1 AP action. Unless otherwise specified you can only apply and remove enhancement gems on your own equipment, or equipment of willing creatures.

### Enhancement Seals

Enhancement Seals work like gems with a range of +t to +5 but rather than conferring an enhancement bonus this is instead in relation to the cost of weapon special abilities. Once applied all special abilities such as flaming, fortification, etc… are applied to the weapon or armor. Similar to gems it requires a 3 AP action to apply and a 1 AP action to remove. Unless otherwise specified you can only apply and remove enhancement seals on your own equipment, or equipment of willing creatures.

## Direct Enhancement

Enhancing a weapon directly applies both the enhancement bonuses and special abilities directly to a piece of equipment disallowing the enhancements from being moved to other items like gems and seals.

### Enhancements and Ammunition

If a weapon applies a special effect (such as dealing fire damage) it may apply these effects to the ammunition it shoots. If the ammunition has its own enhancements, firstly the Enhancement bonus to-hit of the higher applies. Special abilities (such as bane) only apply from a single weapon and use the special abilities of the ammunition before the weapon; thus if a creature would wish to use the weapon's enhancements instead of the enhancements of the ammunition they would need to utilize mundane ammunition with the weapon.

# Weapon Enhancement

Weapons are enhanced to become more accurate and deliver more damage, having an enhancement bonus from their equipped gem ranging +1 to +5. These bonuses are applied to both the attack and damage rolls of the weapon when used in combat.

The cost of enhancing an enhancement gem and an enhancement seal is the same following the below chart. Each scaling from +1 to +5. The cost formula is Bonus ^ 4 x 200 making the chart as follows:

|Enhancement Bonus|Cost(GP)|
|---|---|
|+1|200|
|+2|3200|
|+3|16200|
|+4|51200|
|+5|125000|

Because the special abilities are separate a weapon could be made as follows:

- Example: A +1 Flaming Longsword would have the final cost of 415 gp. 15gp for the longsword, 200gp for the +1 and 200gp for the flaming.
- Example2: A +1 Vorpal Longsword would have a final cost of 125215gp; 15gp for the longsword, 200gp for the +1 and 125000gp for the Vorpal which has a +5 special ability cost.

## Enhancing Shields

Shields are enhanced as weapons, but may also take shield special abilities in addition to weapon special abilities; in addition the weapon enhancement bonus is applied to its shield granting shields a +1 enhancement bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and to the shield’s shield bonus.

## Enhancing Double & Combination Weapons

Enhancing a double or combination weapon requires both ends to be enhanced separately, each requiring their own gem and seal to be applied to each end of the weapon; or in the case of direct enhancement simply enhancing each end as a separate weapon. This allows for each end to not only have its own separate enhancement bonuses but also different special abilities.

# Armor Enhancement

Armor is enhanced to become more effective at protecting its wearer, having an enhancement bonus from their equipped gem ranging +1 to +5. These bonuses are applied to both the armor bonus of the armor.

The cost of enhancing an enhancement gem and an enhancement seal is the same following the below chart. Each scaling from +1 to +5. Armor enchantments will work similarly to armor but the cost is adjusted to Bonus ^ 4 x 100

|Enhancement Bonus|Cost|
|---|---|
|+1|100|
|+2|1600|
|+3|8100|
|+4|25600|
|+5|62500|

Clothing may be enhanced like armor, allowing characters who cannot wear armor to still benefit from armor enhancement bonuses and special abilities.

## Enchanting Clothing

Characters who are prohibited from wearing armor may choose to enhance their clothing. Clothing is enhanced like armor without counting as armor; as such weapon special abilities that can only be added to light or heavy armor cannot be applied to clothing.

# Implement Enhancement

Implements are enhanced to boost the accuracy and potency of spells, having an enhancement bonus from their equipped gem ranging +1 to +5. These bonuses are applied to both the attack and damage rolls of spells cast while wielding it that require an attack roll and/or deal damage, while also granting this bonus to any save attack rolls of spells.

You do not gain the benefits of implement special abilities for wielding two implements at once; in addition once you use a implement with a seal of implement special abilities (such as extra spell and extra talent), you cannot benefit from a different seal's implement special abilities for 8 hours.

The cost of enhancing an enhancement gem and an enhancement seal is the same following the below chart. Each scaling from +1 to +5. The cost formula is Bonus ^ 4 x 200 making the chart as follows:

|Enhancement Bonus|Cost(GP)|
|---|---|
|+1|200|
|+2|3200|
|+3|16200|
|+4|51200|
|+5|125000|

## Weapons As Implements

Some classes allow implements to be a weapon they attune to. Weapons or other enhanced equipment used as an implement apply their weapon enhancement bonus to their spells as an enhanced implement at no additional cost. Weapon implements may take both weapon special abilities as well as implement special abilities (though each still shares the same capacity of +5 of special abilities).

This is generally a powerful and cost effective solution which is why only certain classes have the ability to allow their weapon to also be used as an implement.

# Crafting Enhancements

A character may attempt to enhance their own equipment or create a magic gem/seal themselves rather than paying another to do it for them, similar to crafting any other item. By default a character must have a BCB to craft an item, but some feats and abilities may allow a creature to substitute their skill ranks in place of BCB.

First to enhance an item you must have at least 75% of the cost of the item in materials to perform the enhancement; this cost includes the seal or gem being utilized if not enhancing an item directly. Next you must have a BCB equal to 3x the pluses of the enchantment being placed; for example a character must be at least 3rd BCB to craft their own +1, while a character would need to be 15th BCB to craft a +5.

Finally creating the item works similarly to crafting using a profession check, but using your BCB and your CAM instead of the skill. The DC to craft the item is DC 15 + the BCB requirement to craft the item (as such a +1 item would require a DC 18 BCB check to craft). For each degree of success you exceed the DC you improve the progress you make for the day by double (one degree being double, two degrees being triple, and three degrees being quadruple and so-on). If you successfully exceed the cost of the item by 5 degrees of success you gain the usual progress increase, but also reduce the cost of crafting the item by 5% (to a minimum of 50% of the cost of the item). Enhancements are crafted at 1,000 gp of progress each day.  

Progress in excess of what is needed for the item may be applied to the next enhancement even if it's not exactly the same type of enhancement (such as armor vs weapon enhancement, or different special abilities), though cannot be applied to other forms of crafting.

A failed check results in no progress, but a failure by one degree or greater causes a waste of raw materials equal to the base progress of the item that day, to a maximum of the initial cost (the 75% of cost in raw materials).

To complete an item you have gained enough progress for, the crafter must make a final check against the craft DC of the item. If successful the item is finished; some items gain additional benefits based on the degrees of success of this final check. If this check fails by less than one degree the final cost of the item is increased by 50%, but the item is still finished. A failure by one degree or more fails to craft the item.

# Special Abilities Lists

Different equipment such as weapons, shields, armor, and implements have their own specific special abilities they can be applied to them, ranging in cost from +1 to +5 similar to the weapon enhancement bonus. While the pluses by themselves do not provide a specific benefit they are used to limit the quantity and individual power of special abilities that can be placed onto a single piece of equipment.

Unless otherwise specified you may not add a single special ability more than once.

## Weapon Special Abilities

|Name|Price|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Anchoring|+2|This special ability can only be added to a melee weapon. An anchoring weapon pins a target in place and prevents it from moving. As a 1 AP action, the weapon can be fixed in place at a point in space. This ability can also be used when the wielder hits a creature with a melee attack using an anchoring weapon. This anchors the target to the weapon, preventing it from moving away from the weapon. The target is not entangled or paralyzed; it simply cannot move from its location without first destroying the weapon or making a successful DC 30 Strength check as a 4 AP action to move with the weapon up to 10 feet. An anchoring weapon remains motionless and cannot be used to attack while it is anchoring a creature. An anchoring weapon has no effect on amorphous creatures, including elementals, oozes, and creatures in gaseous or liquid form. It also cannot anchor incorporeal creatures unless the weapon also has the ghost touch special ability.|
|Bane|+1|A bane weapon excels against certain foes. When creating a bane special ability select a single creature type; if selecting humanoids or outsiders pick a single subtype as well. Against a designated foe, the weapon’s enhancement bonus is +2 better than its actual bonus (allowing it to go above +5). It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against such foes.<br><br>You may perform a ritual to re-attune an existing bane enchantment to a new creature type. You must spend one week, focusing at least 8 hours each day, and make a DC 10 knowledge check appropriate to identify the new creature type, to then attune the bane enchantment to a new creature type.|
|Brilliant Energy|+4|A brilliant energy weapon has much if not all of the weapon transformed into light or a near-pure form of energy. Despite this the weapon weighs as much as it usually would. While drawn the weapon sheds light in a 20 foot radius, and ignores all armor and shield bonuses to AC a creature possesses (including any enhancement bonuses their armor or shield may possess); all other bonuses to AC still apply as normal. This type of weapon does not harm undead, objects, or constructs; but still harms living constructs.|
|Called|+1|A creature possessing a called weapon may attune with a weapon at the beginning of each day. Once attune the creature may teleport the weapon to themselves from up to 100 feet away as a reaction. The creature does not need line of sight or line of effect, but effects that would interfere with teleportation prevent the return of a called weapon.|
|Composite Elemental Fury|+2|This special ability functions as elemental fury, but you select two elements when creating this enhancement. You deal 1d6 damage to each chosen element.<br><br>This ability does not stack with Elemental Fury or Improved Elemental Fury.|
|Defending|+1|As a free action, at the start of the wielder’s turn, the creature may choose to transfer the weapons enhancement bonus to their AC. This bonus is treated as a untyped bonus that stacks with all others. This bonus to AC lasts until the start of their next turn.<br><br>  <br>This special ability may be placed on melee weapons, but not shields.|
|Designating|+2|A creature struck by a designating weapon grants the wielder’s allies a +2 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls against the target for 1 round. Multiple attacks against the same target does not increase the bonus or duration, though multiple creatures may be affected by a designated weapon at once.<br><br>  <br>This special ability can only be placed on ranged weapons or ammunition.|
|Designating, Greater|+4|A creature struck by a designating weapon grants the wielder’s allies a +4 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls against the target for 1 round.

|Distance|+1|A weapon with the distance special ability have double the range increment the weapon would normally possess. This increases the range increment of ranged weapons, thrown weapons, and even improvised thrown weapons if they would possess this special ability.|
|Elemental Fury|+1|When creating an Elemental Fury select a single elemental damage type. As a free action you may activate or deactivate the elemental effect upon the weapon, remaining activated until deactivated again. While active the weapon blazes with elemental energy dealing an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen elemental type on a successful hit. The elemental effect covering the weapon does not harm the wielder. Even if choosing a different element you may not apply elemental fury more than once to a single weapon.|
|Elemental Fury, Improved|+2|This special ability functions as elemental fury, but deals 2d8 damage instead of 1d6 of the chosen elemental type.<br><br>This ability does not stack with Elemental Fury or Composite Elemental Fury.|
|Endless Ammunition|+2|Each time an endless ammunition weapon is reloaded, a single non-magical piece of ammunition is spontaneously created by the magic. The creature does not need to supply ammunition to the weapon (though may choose to use other ammunition if they wish), but must still take the same action as normal to reload the weapon.<br><br>  <br><br>  <br>The ammunition created through this effect vanishes when removed from the weapon after 1 round.<br><br>Only projectile keyword ranged weapons can be made into endless ammunition weapons.|
|Fortuitous|+1|Once per round, when the wielder successfully hits with an attack of opportunity, they may choose to make an additional attack against the same creature at a -5 penalty; this additional attack does not cost an additional reaction to make.<br><br>  <br>This special ability can be placed only on melee weapons.|
|Furious|+2|A furious weapon serves as a focus for its wielder’s anger. When the wielder is raging, the weapon’s enhancement bonus is +2 better than normal.<br><br>  <br><br>  <br>If the wielder has a barbaric path that gives a skill bonus while raging, the wielder gains an enhancement bonus to that skill whenever the weapon is wielded or held in her hand, even when they are not raging. This bonus is equal to the enhancement bonus of the weapon, including the additional +2 if the wielder is also raging.<br><br>This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons.|
|Ghost Touch|+1|A weapon with the ghost touch special ability allows the wielder to deal damage normally against a incorporeal creature, rather than the normal immunity or 50% reduction in damage it would normally provide. When applied to a shield this also allows the shield's bonus to AC apply against the attacks of an incorporeal creature.<br><br>  <br>In addition a ghost touch weapon may be picked up and wielded by a incorporeal creature allowing them to attack corporeal foes.|
|Impacting|+2|An impact weapon delivers additional force when it strikes. An impact weapon deals damage as if it were one size category larger. In addition the weapon is treated as having the “pushing” weapon special feature.<br><br>  <br>This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons, but not light weapons.|
|Menacing|+1|A creature with a menacing weapon receives an additional +2 bonus to attack rolls when flanking, in addition any other ally flanking the creature also receives this +2 bonus against the same creature.<br><br>  <br>This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons.|
|Merciful|+1|A merciful weapon deals 1d6 additional damage, but all damage dealt by the weapon is automatically nonlethal damage. The wielder does not take a penalty on attack rolls for dealing nonlethal damage with this weapon even if it normally would not be a nonlethal weapon.<br><br>The wielder may choose to suppress this ability as a reaction for 1 round, allowing it to resume dealing lethal damage, but also suppressing the additional 1d6 damage of this feature.|
|Phase Locking|+2|A creature damaged by a phase locking weapon is unable to use teleportation, summoning, or other extradimensional abilities or spells for 1 round.|
|Second Chance|+4|When a ranged attack made with this weapon misses its target, the weapon’s wielder can cause the shot to curve and attempt to hit the target again. The attacker may roll again using the same bonus as the first attack to see if this new attack would hit. This ability may only be used once per round.<br><br>  <br>This special ability can only be placed on bows or crossbows.|
|Sharding|+1|A sharding weapon may be used to make a ranged attack in place of a melee attack, creating a duplicate of itself that flies as if thrown by the wielder. The duplicate has a range increment of 10 feet and is treated as a thrown weapon attack; but otherwise is treated the same as the original weapon. The duplicate vanishes after the attack is resolved. This may be placed on a thrown weapon allowing the creature to simply make thrown attacks with the same weapon repeatedly without actually throwing the base weapon.<br><br>  <br>This ability can be placed only on melee or thrown weapons.|
|Spell Storing|+1|A spell storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 6 BCB in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 4 AP or less) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast another spell into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons.|
|Sniper, Distant|+2|If the wielder of a distant sniper weapon possesses the sneak attack class feature, they may add an additional 60 feet + 10 feet per +1 enhancement bonus the weapon possesses, to the maximum range at which they may use the sneak attack ability.<br><br>This special ability can only be placed on ranged weapons.|

|Sniping, Improved|+2|A wielder of a weapon with this ability gains a +10 competence bonus on Stealth checks to remain hidden using the sniping stealth ability. This does not stack with other Sniping special abilities.<br><br>This special ability can be placed only on projectile keyword weapons.|
|Sniping, Greater|+3|A wielder of a weapon with this ability gains a +15 competence bonus on Stealth checks to remain hidden using the sniping stealth ability. This does not stack with other Sniping special abilities.<br><br>This special ability can be placed only on projectile keyword weapons.|
|Speed|+3|When making a focused attack action, the wielder of a speed weapon can make one bonus attack with it. If the creature is using two-weapon fighting with two weapons with the speed enhancement, each weapon individually gains one bonus attack, as these effects are applied separately.|
|Sticky|+1|This special ability can be placed only on reach weapons, piercing melee weapons, and weapons with the flail or unarmed keyword.<br><br>When a sticky weapon scores a critical hit against a target, instead of rolling to confirm the critical threat, the wielder can deal normal damage and attempt a steal combat maneuver check against the target of the attack.

Temporary hit points gained through this effect expire at the start of the wielder’s next turn and do not stack with themselves.<br><br>If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or fewer with a vampiric weapon, the wielder is healed for ½ the damage dealt to the creature as part of the attack. This ability cannot heal the wielder above half his total hit points, and has no effect when used against creatures with less than half the wielder’s hit dice.|
|Vampiric, Greater|+2|This special ability can be placed only on piercing or slashing melee weapons.<br><br>The first time each round that the wielder hits a living target with a vampiric weapon, the weapon grants an amount of temporary hit points to the wielder equal to ½ the damage dealt to the target, to a maximum equal to twice the welder's hit dice. Temporary hit points gained through this effect expire at the start of the wielder’s next turn and do not stack with themselves.<br><br>If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or fewer with a vampiric weapon, the wielder is instead healing for an amount equal to what he would have gained in temporary hit points, with any excess healing over its maximum hit point total applied as temporary hit points with the same duration. This has no effect when used against creatures with less than half the wielder’s hit dice.|
|Vicious|+1|A vicious weapon creates a small eruption of energy when it strikes a target. Upon a successful hit the weapon deals an additional 2d6 points of damage to the target, but also deals 1d6 points of damage to the wielder.<br><br>This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons.|

|Rebounding|+1|A rebounding shield provides an additional +2 bonus to AC against thrown weapons; and may add its shield bonus to the wielder's touch AC against splash weapons. If a splash weapon is thrown at the wielder of a rebounding shield and misses, the wielder may choose the square the splash weapon lands in, rather than the usual random location.|

## Armor Special Abilities

|Name|Price|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Bloodthirsty|+2|Armor with the bloodthirsty special ability treats its enhancement bonus to AC as 1 higher for 1 round after its wearer deals damage with a melee attack. If the wearer of a suit of bloodthirsty armor is also raging, the armor’s enhancement bonus increases by 3 instead.<br><br>  <br>Only light armor can be enchanted with the bloodthirsty special ability.|
|Brawling|+3|The wearer of brawling armor gains a +2 bonus on unarmed strike and natural weapon's attack and damage rolls, including combat maneuver checks made to grapple. Her unarmed strikes and natural weapons count as magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The brawling ability cannot be applied to heavy armor.|
|Defiant|+1|Armor with this special ability excels at blocking the attacks of certain types of creatures, similar to a bane weapon’s excelling against certain foes. Against the designated foe, the item’s enhancement bonus to AC is +2 better than its actual bonus and provides DR 2/— against attacks from that foe. This increase in enhancement bonus applies only to the armor’s enhancement bonus.<br><br>  <br>You may perform a ritual to re-attune an existing defiant enchantment to a new creature type. You must spend one week, focusing at least 8 hours each day, and make a DC 10 knowledge check appropriate to identify the new creature type, to then attune the defiant enchantment to a new creature type.|
|Energy Resistance|+1|A suit of armor with this special ability protects against one type of elemental damage type and is designed with patterns depicting the element it protects against. The armor grants Resist 2 against the chosen element.|
|Energy Resistance, Improved|+2|A suit of armor with this special ability protects against one type of elemental damage type and is designed with patterns depicting the element it protects against. The armor grants Resist 3 against the chosen element.|
|Energy Resistance, Greater|+3|A suit of armor with this special ability protects against one type of elemental damage type and is designed with patterns depicting the element it protects against. The armor grants Resist 4 against the chosen element.|
|Fortification|+1|Armor with this special ability protects vital areas of the wearer against critical hits or precision damage against the wearer. A wearer struck by either has a 25% chance to negate the effect and instead force the damage to be rolled normally without the critical hit or precision damage.|
|Fortification, Improved|+3|Armor with this special ability protects vital areas of the wearer against critical hits or precision damage against the wearer. A wearer struck by either has a 50% chance to negate the effect and instead force the damage to be rolled normally without the critical hit or precision damage.|
|Fortification, Heavy|+5|Armor with this special ability protects vital areas of the wearer against critical hits or precision damage against the wearer. A wearer struck by either has a 75% chance to negate the effect and instead force the damage to be rolled normally without the critical hit or precision damage.|
|Ghost Touch|+2|Armor with this special ability allows its armor bonus to be applied against the attacks of both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. In addition the armor may be worn and interacted with by incorporeal creatures, while still retaining the ability to freely pass through solid objects.|
|Guardian|+1|The wearer of armor with this special ability may transfer some or all of the armor’s enhancement bonus to their saving throws as an untyped bonus. As a free action at the start of the wearer’s turn the wearer may choose how to allocate the armor’s enhancement bonus. This bonus lasts until the start of their next turn.|
|Lifesurge|+2|Lifesurge armor boosts and sustains the wielder’s life energy while he is in the throes of combat. The wearer gains a bonus on saving throws against ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain equal to the armor's enhancement bonus. In addition, whenever the wielder receives temporary hit points from any source, he adds the armor's enhancement bonus to these temporary hit points; these temporary hit points do not stack with themselves when receiving temporary hit points from multiple sources.|
|Sensing|+3|A set of sensing armor compensates when its wearer has been blinded, is in total darkness (as long as the wearer doesn’t have darkvision or the see in darkness ability), or is in magical darkness (as long as the wearer doesn’t have the see in darkness ability). When one of these conditions affects the wearer, sensing armor immediately grants its wearer blindsight with a 5-foot range and blindsense with a 60-foot range. As soon as the wearer can see, the additional senses end. The wearer can’t gain these abilities by closing her eyes.|
|Shadow Blending|+2|This effect grants the wearer an additional 20% miss chance to attacks against them in dim light (effectively granting them a 40% miss chance). This doesn’t improve the concealment to total concealment, only improving the miss chance of the concealment provided by dim light.|
|Stanching|+1|Stanching armor reduces damage caused by bleed effects by an amount equal to the armor’s enhancement bonus. In addition the user adds the armor’s enhancement bonus to tenacity checks to become stable.|
|Titanic|+2|A creature wearing titanic armor is considered one size category larger for the purposes of using, or being targeted by, special attacks that are dependent on size. In addition, once per minute as a free action the wearer can add the armor’s enhancement bonus to a single combat maneuver check, or to their CMD against a single combat maneuver. Because of its great bulk, the strength rating of titanic armor is increased by an amount equal to half its enhancement bonus (minimum 1).|
|Unbowed|+5|When the wearer of this armor would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by an attack that dealt hit point damage, the wearer can instead negate all of the attack’s damage as a reaction. Doing so destroys the armor dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage per point of AC bonus the armor possesses (including enhancement bonuses), to all creatures within 10 feet of the wearer. A successful DC 20 reflex save halves this damage; this save DC increases by 1 per point of enhancement bonus the armor possesses. The armor is permanently destroyed and cannot be restored once this ability has been used.<br><br>  <br>This ability can be applied only to heavy armor.|
|Volcanic|+2|As a 2 AP action the wearer may command the armor to emit a cloud of smoke and shoot forth molden liquid in a 5 foot radius of the wearer. The smoke provides concealment, and the liquid deals 2d6 points of fire damage plus 1d6 per point of enhancement bonus the armor possesses. After one round the effect ceases and causes the liquid to solidify creating difficult terrain.<br><br>  <br>The wearer of this armor is unaffected by the smoke, fire, or difficult terrain created by this armor. This may be used once per day plus an additional time per enhancement bonus the armor possesses.|

## Implement Special Abilities

|Name|Price|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Extra Affinity|+1|The implement grants the wielder an additional affinity talent while held; and may be used when assembling spells as part of prepared spellcasters.<br><br>The wielder must be holding the implement to cast a spell he lacks the affinity talent for normally regardless of if he is spontaneous or prepared.<br><br>This special ability may be applied to an implement more than once.|
|Extra Spell|+1|The implement grants the wielder access to a single spell (but not talent) while wielded. The caster must have, or the implement must grant, any prerequisite affinity talents in order to cast this spell.<br><br>This special ability may be applied to an implement more than once.|
|Extra Talent|+1|The implement grants the wielder access to a single magic talent but not spell. This talent has no benefit unless the implement or the caster already possesses the prerequisite affinity or spell for the talent to cast it.<br><br>This special ability may be applied to an implement more than once.|
|Ghost Touch|+1|An implement with the ghost touch special ability allows the wielder's spells to deal damage normally against a incorporeal creature, rather than the normal immunity or 50% reduction in damage it would normally provide.<br><br>This special ability may be applied to an implement more than once.|
|Overwhelming|+3|An implement with this special ability must also possess the extra affinity special ability. An implement with overwhelming treats a creature as having 2 lower resist against the element matching the implement’s affinity(s) for determining their damage reduction and bonus to saves against that element.|
|Spell Piercing|+1|You may add the implement’s enhancement bonus to the percentile rolls to overcome spell resistance.|
