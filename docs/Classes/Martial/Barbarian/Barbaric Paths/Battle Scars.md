Description: "The barbarianâ€™s body has hardened from past battles. The barbarian gains +1 natural armor bonus (or increases his existing natural armor by an equal amount) and reduces the damage he takes from bleed by 1 for any ongoing bleed effects on himself. This natural armor and bleed reduction increases by an additional 1 at 6th level and every 6 levels thereafter."
