Prerequisite: "Barbarian 4th"
Description: "Some barbarians are adept at fighting foes much larger than themselves. Once per round as a reaction the barbarian may choose a single for within his line of sight, until the end of his turn, that target’s reach is treated as if it were 5 feet shorter when interacting with the barbarian. The barbarian may treat a foe’s reach as 5 feet shorter for every 5 levels beyond 5th he possesses."
