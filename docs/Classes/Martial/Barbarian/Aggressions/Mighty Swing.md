Prerequisite: "Barbarian 7th"
Description: "The barbarian may spend 3 fury as a 3 AP action to make a special sunder maneuver against a target. If successful the target’s DR is reduced by half for 1 minute or until the target receives healing equal to or greater than the barbarian’s Endurance modifier. At 15th level if the target does not possess DR the target instead gains vulnerability to a single physical damage type matching the damage type of the weapon used to make this sunder."
