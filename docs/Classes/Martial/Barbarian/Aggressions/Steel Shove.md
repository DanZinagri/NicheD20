Description: "The barbarian may spend 1 fury to make a Shove reposition attempt in place of a melee attack (using the base attack bonus of the replaced attack). If he succeeds the creature takes damage equal to his strength modifier and is subject to a reposition attempt (choosing to move with the creature or not as normal). At 11th level the barbarian may add any enhancement bonuses to his armorâ€™s AC to this combat maneuver attempt and the damage of this ability."
