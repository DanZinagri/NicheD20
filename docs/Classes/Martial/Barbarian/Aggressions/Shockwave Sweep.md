Description: "The barbarian swings his weapon with such force it causes a shockwave to emanate out from him. The barbarian may spend 2 fury as a 3 AP action to damage all foes within a cone of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 barbarian levels, dealing the barbarian’s weapon damage plus an additional 1d6 damage per three barbarian levels (with a damage type of the weapon used with this ability). Creatures within this area are subject to a Physical save attack. A failed save attack deals half damage. At 11th level the barbarian may increase the AP and fury cost of this ability by 1 to instead cause damage in a radius burst around the barbarian but at ½ the range."
