Description: "As a 4 AP action while raging, the barbarian can spend 1 point of fury lift and hurl an object up to one size category smaller than himself with both hands or two size categories smaller with one hand as an improvised thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. This inflicts 1d6 damage plus an additional 1d6 per size category above tiny This damage is halved if the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. Even if using a weapon with this ability the barbarian does not use the statistics of the weapon for this attack (damage dice, crit, keywords, etc..) as its is treated as an improvised thrown weapon regardless; enhancement bonuses to hit and damage may apply as normal.<br><br>The barbarian may spend 2 fury to reduce this to a standard action."
