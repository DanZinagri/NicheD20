Prerequisite: "Barbarian 7th"
Description: "Once per round the barbarian may spend 1 fury to gain 10% spell resistance as a reaction when targeted by a spell. The barbarian must be aware of the caster at the time this ability is used. The barbarian may choose to spend additional fury when using this ability to gain additional 10% spell resistance, though cannot gain more than 50% spell resistance in a single use. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter the barbarian gains 5 more spell resistance per fury spent, and improves the maximum spell resistance of this ability by 5%. This spell resistance lasts until the start of the barbarian's next turn."
