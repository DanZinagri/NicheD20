Prerequisite: "Barbarian 7th"
Description: "You make an upwards swing going under the foeâ€™s guard and potentially unbalancing them. The barbarian may spend 2 fury when making a focused attack. The fighter rolls his attack as normal, but the foe must make a sense motive check against this attack roll, if it fails to exceed this attack the foe is treated as if you had successfully used feint on that foe before this attack. In addition feats that modify feint (besides changing the action required to use it) may be applied to this feint attempt (such as Greater feint increasing the duration of the feint effect)."
