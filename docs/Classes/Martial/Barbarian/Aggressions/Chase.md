Description: "Once per round the barbarian may spend 1 fury as a reaction to move up to his speed. He may only use this ability when a foe within his reach uses an action to move away from him; and his movement must end adjacent (or as close as possible) to the creature that moved. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal."
