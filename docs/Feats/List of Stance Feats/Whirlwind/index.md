You cannot designate the same creature as the target of both the primary and the additional attacks. You may move both before, after, and between these attacks.<br><br>At +11 BAB and every 5 thereafter, you may designate one additional target as part of Whirlwind Strike and make an additional attack against it with the usual cumulative penalties and restrictions as other attacks made as part of this feat. You may not designate a creature as the additional target if it was previously designated as a target of Whirlwind Strike.<br></p></span></p><h4><span><p>Improved Whirlwind Stance (Martial)</p></span></h4><p><span><p><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Whirlwind Stance, Base Attack Bonus +6<br></p></span></p><p><span><p><b>Benefit</b>:    When you move more than 5 feet in a turn, the concealment granted by Whirlwind Stance applies against all attacks, not only ranged attacks.
