Affinity talents are a unique type of talent in that they serve multiple purposes. They work as a baseline for many spell qualifications, unlocking various spells when they’re picked up, usually at least one is granted by a class at first level. They assist spells with the elemental _Keyword'_: to define the damage type of the spell. A number also functions as a spell granting some minor ability.

All affinity talents have an Essence or Anima version which represent opposing forces of that element. A creature must select once the talent is acquired, though some classes may also define if you obtain the Essence or Anima effect as well. Gaining an affinity talent a second time does not grant the opposite effect and instead feats or other effects must be taken to gain the opposite side of their affinity talents.
