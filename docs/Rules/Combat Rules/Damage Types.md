Damage is default organized into two types, Physical and Elemental, though various types exist within these two categories of damage types. While damage types are largely for theme of the weapon or effect at play, these can have various interactions in combat depending on the type being used.
## Physical Damage

Physical damage is any damage of Piercing, Slashing, or Bludgeoning damage. Physical damage is generally affected by DR the creature possess. Some DR may be overcome by a specific physical damage type which is usually specified by the weapon dealing the damage. 

In some rare circumstances a weapon may possess multiple damage types, either in the form of giving a choice when making an attack in different ways to deal different damage types (such as a weapon dealing Piercing OR Slashing), or in the rare case a weapon may deal two damage types at once (such as Bludgeoning AND Piercing). In the case where they weapon offers a choice, the choice must be made before the attack is made dealing the chosen damage type. When multiple damage types are present at once, the weapon is treated as having both damage types for the purposes of determining its interaction with DR, bypassing this as long as even one of its damage types matches. This simply expands the utility of a weapon and does not cause the weapon do deal additional damage or have any other additional effects on its own.
### Bludgeoning Damage

Bludgeoning damage is usually blunt impact type weaponry such as a hammer, fist, or even a rock being thrown at a creature.
### Piercing Damage

Piercing damage is usually attributed to weapons that go for puncture and thrusting type moves such as spears and daggers.

### Slashing Damage

Slashing damage is usually attributed to edged weapons such as swords and axes, going for both a cutting and slicing motion in their attacks.
## Elemental Damage

Elemental damage is separate from physical damage as it is much more varied in type, but also is affected by the resist that a creature possesses. Elemental damage is not inherently magical and may simply represent a natural force at work, such as fire being both capable of being produced by magical and mundane means.

Not all elemental affinities inherently deal elemental damage and may be more closely associated with physical damage types, but usually each element, affinity, and spell will detail what type of damage it does.
### Cold Damage

Cold damage is simply lack of heat to such a drastic degree that it begins to harm, either through the killing of living creatures or even making an object more brittle due to its now frozen state.
### Decay Damage

Decay is another natural process but is usually also associated with death. This may be caused by plague and disease, or simply a spell causing the passage of time to ravage the body of a living creature.
### Fire Damage

Fire damage is any damage dealt via burning and heat, either from mundane fires such as a torch, campfire, or branding iron; or something more magical such as a ball of fire hurled at a foe.
#### Electric Damage

Electric damage deals fire damage for the purposes of its interaction with resistances, but is noted as a separate entity for the purposes of some special interactions it may have. Electrical damage while unique in its delivery is primarily deadly due to the massive amount of heat it produces as it sears its victims.
### Nature Damage

Nature damage is damage is usually damage dealt through venom, poisons, spores, or other naturally occurring but deadly effects. While some magic may produce a more abstract form of nature damage, it is usually reserved for these types of damage.
### Void Damage

Void damage is both the power of aberrant outside forces of the cosmos, as well as simply the type of damage creatures suffer when in the vacuum of space.
