## General Sleet Storm Talents
<h2><span><p>Ice Slick</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Benefit</b>:    You may spend 1 spell point as part of casting Sleet Storm to cause it to leave a field of ice within its area for the duration of the spell. Creatures within the area when the spell is cast are subject to a Physical(Agi) save attack. A successful save attack causes creatures within to fall prone.<br><br>This area is treated as difficult terrain for the duration of the spell. Creatures attempting to move through this area must make an acrobatics check against the save attack of this spell. If you succeed against their Acrobatics check by less than one degree of success the creature cannot move that round and must make a new Physical(Agi) save to avoid falling prone; one degree of success or more against the creatureâ€™s acrobatics check causes them to fall prone without a Physical(Agi) save.<br><br>Each square of ice slick is 1 inch thick with 1 hardness. Creatures may break the ice slick by dealing at least 3 points of damage to an individual square of the ice slick, but the ice returns each round if it remains within the area of the sleet storm.<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Sleet Storm<br><br><b>Saving throw</b>:    Physical(Agi) negates<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Ice Storm</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Benefit</b>:    You may spend 1 spell point when casting sleet storm to improve it to an ice storm. Creatures who begin their turn with the area take 1d6 points of cold damage and 1d6 points of bludgeoning or piercing damage (chosen when the spell is cast) instead of the usual 1d4 cold damage. In addition creatures within the area have their speed reduced by an additional 5 feet (minimum 5 feet). At 10th BCB and every 10 thereafter the cold damage dealt by this spell improves by an additional 1d6.<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Sleet Storm, BCB 6th.<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Wandering Storm</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Special</b>:    Effects that are created within the area (such as the ice slick talent) are created within the new location of the spell as long as it remains in that location for 1 full round; effects last for 1 round per 4 BCB you possess after your sleet storm leaves the area.<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    You may direct your sleet storm as a 2 AP action causing it to move up to 5 feet plus 5 feet per 5 BCB.<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Sleet Storm, BCB 8th<br><br></p></span></p>
