description: A rain of hot ash falls upon the area, granting concealment to creatures 10 feet away. In addition the ash makes it difficult to breathe subjecting them to a save attack at the start of their turn, dealing 1d2 points of Endurance damage on a successful save attack.  Creatures within the area take 1d4 + CAM fire damage to creatures that begin their turn within the area. At 5th BCB and every 5 thereafter the damage of this ash improves by an additional 1d4. You may spend 1 spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration.
