Creatures within the area take 1d4 + CAM fire damage to creatures that begin their turn within the area. At 5th BCB and every 5 thereafter the damage of this ash improves by an additional 1d4. You may spend 1 spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration.

The fires may continue to burn after the firestorm ends if there is fuel to sustain the fire, otherwise will go out naturally after the spell ends.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p>Hot Coals</p></span></h2><p><span style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th>Prerequisite</th><td>Ash Rain, BCB 4th</td></tr><tr><th>Spell</th><td>Ash Rain</td></tr><tr><th>Benefit</th><td>Ash rain begins to accumulate on the ground, causing the area to form hot coals that harm creatures attempting to walk over them.
