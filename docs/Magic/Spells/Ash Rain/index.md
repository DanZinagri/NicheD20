## General Ash Rain Talents
<h2><span><p>Firestorm</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Ash Rain, BCB 6th<br><br><b>Spell resistance</b>:    Yes<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    You may spend 1 spell point when casting ash rain to transform it to a fire storm. The distance the spell provides concealment increases to 20 feet, the spell no longer makes it difficult to breathe, but the damage of the spell improves to 2d6 + 1d6 per 4 BCB.<br><br><b>Special</b>:    If using the hot coals talent, the area is treated as containing multiple mundane fires across it of a size equal to the number of d6 the hot coals ability would deal (usually half the damage of the firestorm itself); for the purpose of extinguishing and abilities that can interact with fires. The fires may continue to burn after the firestorm ends if there is fuel to sustain the fire, otherwise will go out naturally after the spell ends.<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Hot Coals</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Ash Rain, BCB 4th<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    Ash rain begins to accumulate on the ground, causing the area to form hot coals that harm creatures attempting to walk over them. Creatures moving through or entering the area of ash rain take half the damage of the ash rain spell in addition to the damage if they begin their turn in the ash rain.<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Wandering Ash Rain</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Ash Rain, BCB 8th<br><br><b>Spell resistance</b>:    Yes<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    You may direct your ash rain as a 2 AP action causing it to move up to 5 feet plus 5 feet per 5 BCB.<br><br><b>Special</b>:    Effects that are created within the area (such as the hot coals talent) are created within the new location of the spell as long as it remains in that location for 1 round; effects last for 1 round per 4 BCB you possess after your ash storm leaves the area; fires within the area may continue to burn if they would naturally be able to continue (provided sufficient fuel).<br><br></p></span></p>
