## General Confusion Talents

<h2><span><p>Greater Confusion</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Confusion<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    When casting confusion you may spend a spell point to instead inflict the creature with the confusion condition, rather than muddled, for the duration of the spell. A success by 4 degrees of success or more causes the creature to gain the madness condition, no duration.<br><br><b>Special</b>:    If you spent a spell point to increase the duration of the confusion spell in addition to this talent, the creature is instead confused for 1 round when your save attack fails by less than one degree; if you fail by at least one degree, but less than two degrees the creature is instead muddled for 1 round.<br><br></p></span></p>
