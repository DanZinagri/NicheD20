description: "You can surround a target with a magical shield for as long as you concentrate. You may spend a spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration for 1 minute per BCB. You may dismiss the spell before its full duration as a 3 AP action. When casting Personal Barrier, choose either to provide either a bonus to the target’s armor check or temporary hit points. \r\r- Deflection: Personal Barrier may provide a +2 deflection bonus to the target’s armor check, improving by an additional +1 for every 6 BCB.\r- Barrier: Personal Barrier provides 1 temporary hit point per point of BCB plus an additional amount equal to your CAM. While concentrating to maintain this spell, these temporary hit points refresh each turn when you spend the action to concentrate. When a spell point is spent to allow the spell to continue without concentration, the barrier instead regains a number of hit points equal to your CAM at the start of the target’s turn (up to the spell’s normal maximum). The spell ends when these temporary hit points are fully depleted."
