description: "You create two illusionary copies of yourself which shares your space and mimics your movements, including moving with you, for as long as you concentrate. You may spend a spell point to the spell to continue without concentration for up to 1 minute per BCB.\r\rAttacks and spells requiring an attack roll targeting you have a chance to target the illusionary copy instead. The copy uses your touch AC, and is destroyed on a successful attack roll against it. At 6 BCB, and every 6 BCB thereafter, an additional copy is created; while concentrating to maintain this spell, you regain 1 copy at the start of your turn if you are below your maximum number of copies (2 + 1 per 6 BCB). The attacker then rolls a d100 for each attack to determine whether the attack is targeting a copy (with 3 copies present the attacker would need above a 75 to hit you as it would be a 25% chance to hit the right target). The spell ends when no copies remain, even if you are concentrating to maintain it. Area spells and spells which do not require an attack roll are not affected by your copies, nor do they destroy them.\rThe attacker must be able to see the illusion to be fooled. If the attacker is blind, or would have some way of easily detecting the real creature, such as blindsight or lifesense, the attacker need not roll to determine if it is attacking the copy."
