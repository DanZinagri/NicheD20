description: Your touch carries the lightest amount of the blight, attacking the constitution of the creature. A successful save attack causes the creature to become sickened for the duration of the spell; if you succeed by 2 degrees or more the target is instead nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for the usual duration of the spell. You may spend one spell point to increase the duration of the spell to 1 minute per BCB.
