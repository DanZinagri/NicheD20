description: "You may spend a spell point to touch a willing creature creating a suit of armor, or a shield, with which you are proficient. This created armor or shield may be of almost any material (such as metal, stone, or ice) using the normal statistics for armor or shields of its type. Armor created in this way only has a number of hit points equal to 5 + 5 per BCB + CAM instead of its usual hit point value; though retains its normal hardness. If cast on a creature already wearing armor it replaces any armor they have instead utilizing the statistics of the conjured armor instead; the conjured armor does not gain the benefits of any enhancement bonuses the existing armor had and instead uses its own values (if any).\r\rThe spell automatically ends when the conjured armor reaches 0 hit points, but does not gain the broken condition at half hit points like normal armor. This armor may be targeted by abilities such as Enhance Equipment to grant it an enhancement bonus, but enhancement bonuses granted in this way do not grant additional hit points like normal armor of its type; but may still improve the hardness as usual. Either the caster or the creature wearing the created armor may dismiss the spell as a 2 AP action."
