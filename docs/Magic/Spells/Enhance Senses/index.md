title: Enhance Senses
keyword: Transmutation
Prerequisites: Nature(Essence) Affinity
Target: You
Duration: Concentration, or 1 minute per BCB (see Description).
Range: Personal
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You may grant yourself enhanced senses, improving your ability to search for and notice minute details, depending on the Sense Type talent applied to it. You may attempt a Perception check using that sense type as part of casting this spell (normally making a non-reactionary Perception check is a 2 AP action); you may roll twice and take the better result on this check. You may concentrate to maintain this effect, making another Perception check each round with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus on that check (up to a maximum of your BCB).
  You may spend an additional spell point to allow this effect to persist for 1 minute per BCB, but doing so only grants its benefits when taking a 2 AP action to attempt a non-reactionary Perception check (including granting the cumulative bonus on Perception checks made during consecutive rounds).
  You may spend a spell point when casting this spell to instead create the effect as a lens, mirror, music box, or other hand-held object which allows you to share the benefits of this spell with adjacent creatures (allowing each creature adjacent to you to make a Perception check as a free action when the spell is cast, or at the start of your turn). 
Special: When you gain this spell, if you don't already have one, select a single Sense Type talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any Sense Type talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters, this spell does not take a slot to prepare but also cannot be used without a Sense Type talent prepared; Sense Type talents take up slots as normal.

Enhance Vision
to magnify your vision across great distances, rather than the spellï¿½s base effect. This effect lasts for 1 minute per BCB. While the magnification is active, reduce any distance penalties to your Perception and ranged attack rolls by half, but you must roll twice and take the worse result on any ranged attack or Perception check made against a target within 30 feet, and take a -1 penalty to AC and Physical saves from attacks and effects originating within 30 feet.

Enhance Vision
to grant yourself vision of a point within medium range. You do not need line of effect to the target point. This creates an invisible sensor, which allows you to treat yourself as standing at the target point for the purposes of making Perception checks, determining line of sight, and any other checks related to your senses (which may include things such as being the target of gaze, sonic, or stench typed attacks). You may use any special senses that you possess (such as Darkvision or Tremorsense) through the sensor.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><span><span><hr></span></span><h1><span><p>Sense Type Talents</p></span></h1><span><span><hr></span></span><h2><span><p>Aural Enhancement</p></span></h2><p><span style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th>Spell</th><td>Enhance Senses</td></tr><tr><th>Prerequisite</th><td>Enhance Senses</td></tr><tr><th>Benefit</th><td>You may gain a bonus on sound-based Perception checks when using Enhance Senses.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p>Olfactory Enhancement</p></span></h2><p><span style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th>Spell</th><td>Enhance Senses</td></tr><tr><th>Prerequisite</th><td>Enhance Senses</td></tr><tr><th>Benefit</th><td>You may gain a bonus on scent and taste-based Perception checks when using Enhance Senses.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p>Optical Enhancement</p></span></h2><p><span style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th>Spell</th><td>Enhance Senses</td></tr><tr><th>Prerequisite</th><td>Enhance Senses</td></tr><tr><th>Benefit</th><td>You may gain a bonus on vision-based Perception checks when using Enhance Senses.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p>Tactile Enhancement</p></span></h2><p><span style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th>Spell</th><td>Enhance Senses</td></tr><tr><th>Prerequisite</th><td>Enhance Senses</td></tr><tr><th>Benefit</th><td>You may gain a bonus on touch-based Perception checks when using Enhance Senses.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p>
