description: The caster may spend a spell point to reanimate the body of a recently deceased creature, if the body is too decayed or too maimed to function (GM discretion) the spell may outright fail, or produce a defective undead (usually requiring at least 80% of a skeleton or body to still be present). Once animated the newly created undead lasts indefinitely until destroyed, and remains loyal to the caster.<br><br>The statistics of this creature is determined by the type of creature it was in life, using the Companion Page to determine specifics, such as its base form and other appropriate talents or traits, such as natural weapons and limbs (ignoring any affinity or form talent prerequisites). The Companion Type should always be undead. The newly created undead has the same number of hit dice as when it was alive, selects a base form matching its form (usually biped for humanoids for example), and automatically gains the undead companion type. The companion gains the undead creature type as well gaining all the usual effects of this creature type. Otherwise the creature retains none of its abilities or special movement modes from when it was alive. The animated dead may benefit from any equipment it possessed or any you provide.<br><br>You can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per BCB. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. In addition you may decide at any point to relinquish control of any undead you currently control. Animated creatures above Large size or smaller than Tiny sized count as 2 HD higher for the purposes of determining your animate dead HD limit. At 10th BCB Huge and Diminutive creatures a treated as only costing 1 HD higher.<br><br>Unlike normal companions, animated undead by default are mindless, possessing a 0 intelligence and having no feats or skill ranks, except for any proficiencies the base creature possessed. You may only issue simple commands to your controlled undead such as “go”, “stay”, “follow me”, “attack”, or “guard”; more complex commands are generally not understood by the undead.<br><br>Unless otherwise specified you may not add companion talents to an animated dead like a normal companion, nor does it grow in strength as you gain additional BCB. When an animated dead is reduced to 0 hit points it is destroyed, and unable to be animated again.
