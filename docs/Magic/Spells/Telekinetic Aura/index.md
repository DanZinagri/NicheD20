Description: You form an aura of telekinetic energy pushing your body beyond its normal limits. This spell lasts for 1 round per BCB, but you may spend 1 spell point to allow the spell to last 1 minute per BCB. The effects of this spell are determined by the aura type talent applied to it, and may only have one telekinetic aura type talent applied to it.
Special: When you gain this spell, if you don't already have one, select a single telekinetic aura type talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any aura type talents you cannot select this spell).

At 11th BCB you may have up to three aura type talents applied at once when using this talent.<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Greater Orbit</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Spell</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Telekinetic Aura, Telekinetic Orbit, BCB 6th<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    Your telekinetic orbit treats its strength score as 4 higher for the purposes of determining the maximum amount it can carry. In addition your orbit now can orbit beyond directly around you, allowing it to orbit up to 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet per 3 BCB, allowing you to move objects across the battlefield and even hand them off to allies at a range (requiring the ally to spend a 2 AP action still to take the item from you on their turn). The save penalty against sunder and disarm maneuvers increases by 1 for every 5 feet the object is from you. When making thrown attacks within the area of your orbit, as long as the attack resolves within the radius of your orbit you may cause the weapon to return to your hand after the attack resolves; attacks outside this radius cannot return. Weapon attacks with ranged weapons treat their distance shot/thrown as a number of feet shorter, equal to the radius of the orbit, for the purposes of determining range increments the weapon has traveled, as the orbit helps propel forward your attacks without loss of potency from distance.<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Telekinetic Sphere</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Spell</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Telekinetic Aura, Greater Aura, Telekinetic Orbit, Greater Orbit, Telekinetic Catch, Telekinetic Zone, BCB 16th<br><br><b>Saving Throw</b>:    Resilience negates<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    When using Telekinetic Zone with Greater Orbit you begin to warp the gravity of the area. Creatures in the area besides are subject to a Resilience save attack, though you may choose to exclude any number of creatures from this effect. A successful save attack causes all affected creatures within to treat their weight as 1/16th their normal weight, and are treated as two categories smaller for the purposes of determining their bonuses to MSB and saves against maneuvers from size. Creatures affected by this zone also reduce the total DC required to jump by half due to the reduced weight. A failed save attack allows the creature to choose if they are affected or not by the ability. In addition all objects within the zone have their weights also reduced by the same amount.<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Telekinetic Zone</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Spell</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Telekinetic Aura, Greater Aura, Telekinetic Orbit, Telekinetic Catch, BCB 8th<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    When using Telekinetic Orbit and Telekinetic Catch as part of the same casting of Telekinetic Aura you spend an additional spell point to create an oppressive aura of telekinetic energy that makes it more difficult to move in. Enemies treat all squares adjacent to you as difficult terrain.<br><br><b>Special</b>:    If you are also using the greater orbit talent this talent affects all squares within the area of your greater orbit.<br><br></p></span></p><h1><span><p>Telekinetic Aura Type Talents</p></span></h1><h2><span><p>Telekinetic Catch</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Spell</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Telekinetic Aura, BCB 6th<br><br><b>Keywords</b>:    Maneuver<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    You must spend an additional spell point to use this talent. For the duration of the spell you may spend a reaction when targeted by a thrown weapon attack or a ranged weapon that uses ammunition to attempt to catch the object with your mind. Make a disarm combat maneuver using your BCB in place of your BAB and your CAM in place of your strength for determining your MSB; if successful the object is caught and the attack is treated as a miss, before the object falls harmlessly to the ground. Ammunition caught from firearm keyword weapons are still automatically destroyed when caught with this ability.<br><br><b>Special</b>:    If you also have the Telekinetic Orbit talent active you may instead cause the object to enter your orbit rather than fall to the floor, allowing you to retrieve the object from the orbit on your turn.<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Telekinetic Leap</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Spell</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    For the duration of the spell, you treat your speed a 5 feet faster for the purpose of performing a charge or run, and gain an additional +1 to attack and damage for the attack made at the end of charge. Your speed for charges improves by an additional 5 at 5th BCB and every 5 thereafter. You may spend an additional spell point when casting Telekinetic Aura to improve your ability to leap while charging, reducing the DC for each foot jumped vertically by 1 (effectively making it 3x the number of feet jumped vertically), and further improve your speed by an additional 5 feet plus an additional 5 feet for every 10 BCB you posses while performing a charge or run action, in addition to the normal benefits granted by this talent.<br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Telekinetic Orbit</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Spell</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    For the duration of the spell you may choose to allow an object you let go of to orbit around you rather than falling to the floor. Objects in orbit cannot be wielded but may be retrieved from the orbit as a reaction; allowing you to free up your hands for additional tasks. You may have one object in orbit at once plus an additional for every 4 BCB you possess. Your orbit has a maximum encumbrance calculated at your BCB + your CAM treated as its strength score; the combined weight of all objects in your orbit cannot exceed the light load of this carry capacity. Objects in the orbit use your saves for the purposes of sunder checks and disarm attempts, but take a -2 penalty to their saves while within the orbit.<br>
You may spend an additional spell point when using this talent to further improve the strength score of this aura for determining itï¿½s encumbrance by an amount equal to your SPB. <br><br></p></span></p><h2><span><p>Telekinetic Shield</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Spell</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Telekinetic Aura<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    You gain a +1 shield bonus to AC for the duration of this spell, this bonus improves by 1 at 6th BCB and every 6 thereafter.

These temporary hit points improve by an additional 1 per 8 BCB you possess.<br><br></p></span></p>
