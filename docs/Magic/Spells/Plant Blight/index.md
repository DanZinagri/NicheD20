description: You may spend a spell point to cause plant life within a 60 foot line, or 10 foot radius to shrink in size to about ⅓  their normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected. The vegetation affected by this may look as if it was carefully pruned and trimmed or as if it has withered (caster’s choice). This has no effect on plant creatures.<br><br>If cast upon plantlife that was magically created (such as the grasping vines spell) you may make an opposed SPB check to dispel the magically enhanced plantlife.<br><br>At 4th BCB this ability may be used to diminish plant life to the extent it removes plant-based cover or concealment provided by trees and undergrowth.<br><br>Plant creatures within the area of this spell begin to wither, taking 1d6 untyped damage per BCB. A failed Resilience(End) save attack deals half damage.
