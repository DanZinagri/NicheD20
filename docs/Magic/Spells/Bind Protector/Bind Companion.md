Description: "You may spend a spell point to summon a creature, binding it to this plane of existence, called a Companion, you have made a contract with causing it to appear in an adjacent square, ready to act on your following turn. You must concentrate to maintain the Companion's presence, but may always spend an additional spell point to allow the summoned creature to remain for 1 minute per BCB without concentration.\r\rCompanions can take mamy forms decided by a combination of its form, type, and traits. While there are nearly no limits to how you may make your Companion look, you cannot choose a Companion with the exact same appearance as another creature (though the Companion still has the Disguise skill and similar options available to it). Regardless of what type a summoned Companion choses it always will have the Elemental type with a subtype matching the affinity talent required to summon a creature of their base type; in addition to any other types determined by their companion type. For example a animal type would be both Beast, and a Elemental(Nature) type due to the nature affinity requirement.\rWhen you gain this spell, you automatically gain a single Companion of your choice; Chosing its Form, Type, and Traits as described on the Companion Rules page.\rIf a Companion is summoned multiple times during a day, they do not regain hit points or other resources spent; only regaining them when you would rest and regain resrouces such as spell points. If a Companion is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, they instantly disappear and cannot be summoned again until the following day. A Companion may be dismissed as a free action. Unless otherwise specified a companion will always follow the orders of the summoner and generally will not act on its own other than to defend itself, or to carry out any long-standing orders (such as \"Defend me\" or \"Defend my allies\").\rWhile the home plane of a Companion is generally open for roleplay options, the creature for mechanical purposes simply ceases to exist when it is not summoned. Because of this it may not carry items or store items in their home plane or bring items to the caster's plane, and leaves any items it is wearing or is carrying behind when it leaves this plane. Talents that grant equipment are an exception, but simply disappear when the creature is unsummoned.\rCompanions made through this spell have access to any traits available through form talents, alter talents, or companion talents, you have available."
Special: "To gain this spell you must qualify for a single Companion type to design your Companion with. Information on the progression and talents for Companions can be found on the Companion Page.\r\rIf a creature already possesses this spell, but is granted this spell again they instead gain Extra Companion as a bonus talent."
Note: "(Spontaneous Vs Prepared) When a spontaneous caster gains this spell and talents that modify a Companion, the Companion is always summoned with the selected talents; this applies to talents applied to Companions taken with the additional Companion talent. Effectively talents are applied to a Companion the moment the spontaneous caster gains the talent, without the ability to remove it later unless they would be able to un-learn and replace the talent.\rPrepared casters may decide their Companion and talents as part of preparing their spells each day, effectively creating a new contract to bind a creature meeting their specifications that day. For roleplay purposes that can be the same creature, simply modified each time; but this has no impact on the actual form or talents a creature would possess."
