description: " You may spend a spell point to cause yourself to be surrounded by a series of floating bones that help reduce incoming damage. You summon one bone per 4 BCB (minimum 1). For each bone you have summoned you gain DR 2/- (stacking with itself). For every 20 points of damage prevented by this spell a bone is destroyed, lowering the DR provided by this spell by 2. Once all bones are destroyed the spell immediately ends."
