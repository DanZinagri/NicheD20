description: " You may spend a spell point to cause yourself to be surrounded by a series of floating bones that help reduce incoming damage. You summon one bone per 4 BCB (minimum 1). For each bone you have summoned you gain DR 2/- (stacking with itself). For every 20 points of damage prevented by this spell a bone is destroyed, lowering the DR provided by this spell by 2. Once all bones are destroyed the spell immediately ends."

## General Bone Shield Talents
<h2><span><p>Bone Fists</p></span></h2><p><span><p><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Bone Shield<br><br><b>Benefit</b>:    While under the effects of bone shield you may spend an additional spell point to become further empowered, as your bones themselves begin to harden and sharply protrude. This grants the caster a +1 bonus to natural armor, a +2 bonus on damage rolls with natural weapons and unarmed strikes, and causes creatures who attempt to grapple the caster to take 1d4 points of piercing damage. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell, even after the last bone of the bone shield is destroyed.<br><br></p></span></p>
