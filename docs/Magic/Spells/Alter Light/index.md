description: You create a sphere centered anywhere within the range of the spell. Alter light radiates from a central point adjusting the light level depending on the Light Type talent applied to it. You may concentrate on the spell to maintain it, or spend 1 spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration for 1 minute per BCB.
Special: When you gain this spell, if you donâ€™t already have one, select a single light type talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any light type talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters this spell does not take a slot to prepare, but also cannot be used without a light type talent prepared, light type talents take up slots as normal.
