Duration: 1 Round per BCB (see text)

Action: 5 AP
Saving Throw: none
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to summon a single creature, or a number of creatures, within close range, ready to act on your following turn. Creatures summoned with this ability last for 1 round per BCB and act on your initiative. Unlike summoned companions these creatures cannot be freely modified with companion talents and instead come in a set of archetypes. Summoning a creature with this spell allows you to summon a single creature of the highest tier you may summon, 1d3 creatures of the 2nd highest tier, or 1d4+1 of all tiers below your 2nd highest summoning tier.
  At 3rd BCB all creatures summoned with this ability gain the creature of battle talent using the caster's SPB to determine the power of this talent rather than the hit dice of the creatures it's been applied to. The creature choses 2 natural weapons they possess to grant the enhancement bonus to.
  Creatures summoned by this spell are defined by archetypes and tiers. The following table defines the tiers of creature, which determines the minimum BCB to cast them, their Hit dice, as well as details about their inherent bonus progression. In addition feats a creature would normally gain are instead pre-determined based on their companion type, determined by their archetype.
  Creatures gain Inherent bonuses to their ability scores as they go up in tier, gaining a +1 to a single ability score at tier 1, +1 to 3 scores at tier 2, and gaining an additional +1 to all listed attributes every tier thereafter (at +9 by tier 10). These ability scores are listed in the creature's archetype section.

  | Tier | Minimum BCB | Hit Dice | Number of Feats by Tier |
  | ---- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
  | I    | 1st         | 1        | 1                       |
  | II   | 3rd         | 2        | 1                       |
  | III  | 5th         | 4        | 2                       |
  | IV   | 7th         | 6        | 3                       |
  | V    | 9th         | 8        | 3                       |
  | VI   | 11th        | 10       | 4                       |
  | VII  | 13th        | 12       | 5                       |
  | VIII | 15th        | 14       | 6                       |
  | IX   | 17th        | 16       | 7                       |
  | X    | 19th        | 18       | 8                       |

  Note: A creature who is summoned by this ability who gains Two-Weapon fighting but only possesses a single natural weapon gains a slam natural weapon appropriate to their size, that they may use with a single available appendage (head, leg, arm, etc..). This is in addition to any natural weapons they already possessed, allowing them to properly utilize two-weapon fighting.
  Creatures summoned with this spell fall into a number of specific archetypes of creature; these archetypes have set base forms, types, or any other specified talents the creature may possess. In addition each archetype requires its own affinity to summon; this ignores the usual affinity requirements of talents for a companion such as its companion type and instead only requires the listed affinity talent to summon.

  | Archetype | Base Form | Companion Type | Size | Minimum Tier | Required Affinity | Inherent Bonus Increases |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Wolf | Beast | Animal | Medium | I | Nature | Str, End,     Agi |
  | Wolf, Dire | Beast | Animal | Large | IV | Nature | Str, End,     Agi |
  | Spider | Arachnid | Animal | Small | I | Nature | Str, End,     Agi |
  | Spider, Large | Arachnid | Animal | Medium | III | Nature | Str, End,     Agi |
  | Snake | Serpent | Animal | Medium | I | Nature | Str, End,     Agi |
  | Eel | Serpent | Aquatic-Animal | Small | I | Water | Str, End,     Agi |

  The following table details feats gained by creatures based on their archetype as they gain feats. Creatures gain feats from the list starting from first to last on the list, gaining them in the listed order.
