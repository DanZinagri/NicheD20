description: You may spend a spell point to make a Resilience save attack against a creature. A successful save attack causes the creature to become drowsy making them staggered for 1d4+1 rounds plus an additional two rounds if you succeed by at least one degree. On two degrees of success or more the creature instead falls asleep. Awakening a creature is a 3 AP action. Sleep does not affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures. Failure by less than one degree causes the creature to instead become unbalanced for 1 round.
